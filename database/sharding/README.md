# Data Sharding

- Sharding is a method for distributing a single dataset across multiple databases, which can then be stored on multiple machines.
- Database sharding is the process of making partitions of data in a database or search engine, such that the data is divided into various smaller distinct chunks, or shards.
- This allows for larger datasets to be split into smaller chunks and stored in multiple data nodes, increasing the total storage capacity of the system.
- Data sharding is a common way of implementing horizontal scaling.
- Database sharding divides the table records in a database into smaller portions. Each section is a shard, and is stored on a different server.
